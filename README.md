# Libft
Libft is an essential project in the 42 school curriculum designed to help students deeply understand C programming by creating a personal library of fundamental functions.<br><br>

### Project Objectives<br>
The primary goals of the Libft project include:
Recreating standard C library functions
Learning how core programming functions work internally
Creating a versatile toolkit for future C programming assignments<br>

Functional Breakdown<br>
#### Part 1: Libc Function Reimplementations
The project requires students to recreate standard library functions with the 'ft_' prefix, including:
Character manipulation: ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_toupper
String operations: ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strncmp
Memory management: ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_calloc<br>

#### Part 2: Additional Utility Functions<br>
Beyond standard library functions, the project includes creating additional utility functions such as:
ft_substr: Create substrings
ft_strjoin: Concatenate strings
ft_split: Split strings based on a delimiter
ft_itoa: Convert integers to strings<br>

### Technical Requirements<br>
Written in pure C
Compile with:<br>
#### -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags<br>
No global variables allowed
Memory must be properly managed
Create a static library (libft.a)<br>

### Learning Outcomes<br>
By completing Libft, students gain:
Deep understanding of C function implementations
Memory management skills
Custom library creation techniques
Preparation for future programming challenges
The project serves as a crucial foundation for a student's C programming journey, providing a personalized toolkit that can be expanded and refined throughout their programming education
